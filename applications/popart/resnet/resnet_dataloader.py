    # Terminating multiprocessing logic requires very careful design. In
    # particular, we need to make sure that
    #
    #   1. The iterator gracefully exits the workers when its last reference is
    #      gone or it is depleted.
    #
    #      In this case, the workers should be gracefully exited because the
    #      main process may still need to continue to run, and we want cleaning
    #      up code in the workers to be executed.
    #      Naturally, we implement the shutdown logic in `__del__` of
    #      DataLoaderIterator.
    #
    #      We delay the discussion on the logic in this case until later.
    #
    #   2. The iterator exits the workers when the loader process and/or worker
    #      processes exits normally or with error.
    #
    #      We set all workers to have `daemon=True`.
    #
    #      You may ask, why can't we make the workers non-daemonic, and
    #      gracefully exit using the same logic as we have in `__del__` when
    #      the iterator gets deleted (see 1 above)?
    #
    #      First of all, `__del__` is **not** guaranteed to be called when
    #      interpreter exits. Even if it is called, by the time it executes,
    #      many Python core library resources may alreay be freed, and even
    #      simple things like acquiring an internal lock of a queue may hang.
    #      Therefore, in this case, we actually need to prevent `__del__` from
    #      being executed, and rely on the automatic termination of daemonic
    #      children. Thus, we register an `atexit` hook that sets a global flag
    #      `_python_exit_status`. Since `atexit` hooks are executed in reverse
    #      order of registration, we are guaranteed that this flag is set
    #      before library resources we use are freed. (Hooks freeing those
    #      resources are registered at importing the Python core libraries at
    #      the top of this file.) So in `__del__`, we check if
    #      `_python_exit_status` is set or `None` (freed), and perform no-op
    #      if so.
    #
    #      Another problem with `__del__` is also related to the library
    #      cleanup calls. When a process ends, it shuts the all its daemonic
    #      children down with a SIGTERM (instead of joining them without a
    #      timeout). Simiarly for threads, but by a different mechanism. This
    #      fact, together with a few implementation details of multiprocessing,
    #      forcesus to make workers daemonic. All of our problems arise when a
    #      DataLoader is used in a subprocess, and are caused by
    #      multiprocessing code which looks more or less like this:
    #
    #          try:
    #              your_function_using_a_dataloader()
    #          finally:
    #              multiprocessing.util._exit_function()
    #
    #      The joining/termination mentioned above happens inside
    #      `_exit_function()`. Now, if `your_function_using_a_dataloader()`
    #      throws, the stack trace stored in the exception will prevent the
    #      frame which uses `DataLoaderIter` to be freed. If the frame has any
    #      reference to the `DataLoaderIter` (e.g., in a method of the iter),
    #      its  `__del__`, which starts the shutdown procedure, will not be
    #      called. That, in turn, means that workers aren't notified.
    #      Attempting to join in `_exit_function` will then result in a hang.
    #
    #      For context, `_exit_function` is also registered as an `atexit`
    #      call. So it is unclear to me (@ssnl) why this is needed in a finally
    #      block.
    #      The code dates back to 2008 and there is no comment on the original
    #      PEP 371 or patch https://bugs.python.org/issue3050 (containing both
    #      the finally block and the `atexit` registration) that explains this.
    #
    #      Another choice is to just shutdown workers with logic in 1 above
    #      whenever we see an error in `next`. This isn't ideal because
    #        a. It prevents users from using try-catch to resume data loading.
    #        b. It doesn't prevent hanging if users have references to the
    #           iterator.
    #
    #   3. All processes exit if any of them die unexpectedly by fatal signals.
    #
    #      As shown above, the workers are set as daemonic children of the main
    #      process. However, automatic cleaning-up of such child processes only
    #      happens if the parent process exits gracefully (e.g., not via fatal
    #      signals like SIGKILL). So we must ensure that each process will exit
    #      even the process that should send/receive data to/from it were
    #      killed, i.e.,
    #
    #        a. A process won't hang when getting from a queue.
    #
    #           Even with carefully designed data dependencies (i.e., a `put()`
    #           always corresponding to a `get()`), hanging on `get()` can
    #           still happen when data in queue is corrupted (e.g., due to
    #           `cancel_join_thread` or unexpected exit).
    #
    #           For child exit, we register SIGCHLD handler on main process,
    #           which checks if any of the workers fail in the (Python)
    #           handler.
    #           See DataLoader.cpp.
    #
    #           For `.get()` calls where the sender(s) is not the workers, we
    #           guard them with timeouts, and check the status of the sender
    #           when timeout happens:
    #             + in the workers, the `ManagerWatchdog` class checks the main
    #               process status.
    #
    #        b. A process won't hang when putting into a queue;
    #
    #           We use `mp.Queue` which has a separate background thread to put
    #           objects from an unbounded buffer array. The background thread
    #           is daemonic and usually automatically joined when the process
    #           exits.
    #
    #           However, in case that the receiver has ended abruptly while
    #           reading from the pipe, the join will hang forever. Therefore,
    #           for both `worker_result_queue` (worker -> main process)
    #           and each `index_queue` (main process -> worker), we use
    #           `q.cancel_join_thread()` in sender process before any `q.put`
    #           to prevent this automatic join.
    #
    #           Moreover, having all queues called `cancel_join_thread` makes
    #           implementing graceful shutdown logic in `__del__` much easier.
    #           It won't need to get from any queue, which would also need to
    #           be guarded by periodic status checks.
    #
    #           Note that this may leave corrupted data in the queue, but we
    #           don't care about the data anyways once we are shutting down.
    #
    #
    # Now let's get back to 1:
    #   how we gracefully exit the workers when the last reference to the
    #   iteartor is gone.
    #
    # To achieve this, we implement the following logic along with the design
    # choices mentioned above:
    #
    # [worker processes]
    #   While loader process is alive:
    #     Get from index_queue.
    #       If got a `None`, exit.

    #            If set, continue to next iteration
    #                    i.e., keep getting until see the `None`, then exit.

    #
    #        Note: from here on, the workers may exit at

class DataLoader(object):
    r"""
  Data loader. Combines a dataset and a sampler, and provides
  single- or multi-process iterators over the dataset.

  This is a customized DataLoader for popart which is inspired by the torch
  DataLoader. The difference being that the __iter__ call reuses the
  _DataLoader when called multiple times, to prevent the work processes being
  stopped and respawned.

  The DataLoader can be used with the 'enumerate' call to get an interator to
  the data set. The iterator will return numpy arrays.

  Additionally the cuda pin_memory option has been removed.

  Arguments:
      dataset (Dataset): dataset from which to load the data.
      batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
          (default: ``1``).
      shuffle (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled
          at every epoch (default: ``False``).
      sampler (Sampler, optional): defines the strategy to draw samples from
          the dataset. If specified, ``shuffle`` must be False.
      batch_sampler (Sampler, optional): like sampler, but returns a batch of
          indices at a time. Mutually exclusive with :attr:`batch_size`,
          :attr:`shuffle`, :attr:`sampler`, and :attr:`drop_last`.
      num_workers (int, optional): how many subprocesses to use for data
          loading. 0 means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
          (default: ``0``)
      collate_fn (callable, optional): merges a list of samples to form a
          mini-batch.
      drop_last (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete
          batch, if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size.
          If ``False`` and the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch
          size, then the last batch will be smaller. (default: ``False``)
      tensor_type : The type of tensor to be returned. By default the type will
          be float32. This value can be set to 'float32','float16' to return
          the desired type
      timeout (numeric, optional): if positive, the timeout value for
          collecting a batch from workers. Should always be non-negative.
          (default: ``0``)
      worker_init_fn (callable, optional): If not ``None``, this will be called
          on each worker subprocess with the worker id (an int in
          ``[0, num_workers - 1]``) as input, after seeding and before data
          loading. (default: ``None``)

  .. note:: By default, each worker will have its PyTorch seed set to
            ``base_seed + worker_id``, where ``base_seed`` is a long generated
            by main process using its RNG. However, seeds for other libraies
            may be duplicated upon initializing workers (w.g., NumPy), causing
            each worker to return identical random numbers. (See
            :ref:`dataloader-workers-random-seed` section in FAQ.) You may
            use :func:`torch.initial_seed()` to access the PyTorch seed for
            each worker in :attr:`worker_init_fn`, and use it to set other
            seeds before data loading.

  .. warning:: If ``spawn`` start method is used, :attr:`worker_init_fn` cannot
            be an unpicklable object, e.g., a lambda function.
