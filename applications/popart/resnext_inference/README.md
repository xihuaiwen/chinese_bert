# Graphcore benchmarks: ResNeXt inference

This readme describes how to run a ResNeXt101 model for bulk inference on IPUs.

## Overview

ResNeXt is a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification. The network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology.

## ResNeXt101 model

The ResNeXt101 model is taken from the research paper Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431. The simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a new dimension, cardinality, which is the size of the set of transformations. 

## Datasets

This benchmark uses the COCO dataset (COCOval2014) which can be downloaded from here: http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2014.zip)

## Running the model

This application runs resnext101_32d.onnx for inference over 8 IPUs. Each IPU runs a single PopART inference session, and receives one portion of the total dataset.

The following files are provided for running the ResNeXt benchmark.

## Quick start guide

### Prepare the environment

**1) Download the Poplar SDK**

  Install the `poplar-sdk` following the README provided. Make sure to source the `enable.sh`
  scripts for Poplar, gc_drivers (if running on hardware) and PopART.

**2) Python**

Create a virtualenv and install the required packages:

```
bash
virtualenv venv -p python3.6
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prepare the dataset and model
The following script can be run to prepare the data and add the configured model to the directory `models/resnext101_32x4d/`.

```
(popart) $ ./model_prep_helper.sh /localdata/datasets/coco/val2014 datasets
```
the first argument being the path to the COCO dataset, the second being the output directory for the processed datasets.

NOTE: If this the above script is run, the `Prepare the dataset` and `Prepare the model` sections can be skipped.

#### Prepare the dataset

**1) Download the dataset**

Download the the COCO dataset (COCOval2014) from here: http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2014.zip)

**2) Partition the dataset** 

Assuming you are running on 8 IPUs, the COCO dataset should be partitioned into 8 distinct directories so each one can be read and streamed onto an IPU by a different process. To set the dataset partition up, make a directory to contain the data subsets, and then run `partition_dataset.py` as follows:

```
(popart) $ mkdir datasets
(popart) $ python partition_dataset.py --data-dir /localdata/datasets/coco/val2014 --partitions 8 --output datasets
```

Where `data-dir` is the location of the COCO dataset.

#### Prepare the model

This application can run over multiple IPUs. It does this by creating multiple PopART `inference Session`s, each of which uses one ONNX model and processes a fraction of the total batch of data. The size of the data that is used by one model is called the `micro batch size`. The total batch size used will therefore be `micro-batch-size * num-ipus`.

**1) Download the model**

To download the pretrained ResNext101 model from Cadeneâ€™s pretrained models repository (https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch#resnext), convert it to ONNX format, and create a copy with chosen micro batch size (in this example a micro batch size of 6), run:

```
(popart) $ python get_model.py --micro-batch-size 6
```

This will add the configured model to the directory `models/resnext101_32x4d/`.

### Running the model

Now you have set up the data and created the model you can run the model on the partitioned data. The entry point is `resnext_inference_launch.py`. This takes the batch size, which is the sum of all micro batch sizes over all the IPUs you are using.


```
(popart) $ python resnext_inference_launch.py --batch_size 48 --num_ipus 8
```

Logging data, including throughput, is written per subprocess in `logs/` and aggregated over all subprocesses in stdout. Inference results are fetched but not written to file. This can be changed in 'resnext101.py', where outputs are saved as `results`.
