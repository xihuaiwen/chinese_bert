## ResNet-18 Inference Demo

This example uses a pre-trained network to perform inference on images using a port
of TensorFlow that targets Graphcore's Poplar libraries.

### File structure

* `classify_images.py` The main Python script.
* `get_images_and_weights.sh` Script to fetch the images and weights.
* `imagenet_categories.py` Dictionary of the ImageNet category strings.
* `README.md` This file.
* `resnet.py` The model definition.
* `utils.py` Helper functions for building the graph.

### How to use this demo

1) Prepare the TensorFlow environment.

   Install the poplar-sdk following the README provided. Make sure to run the enable.sh scripts and activate a Python virtualenv with gc_tensorflow installed.

2) Download the images and weights.

       ./get_images_and_weights.sh

  This will create and populate the `images/` and `weights/` directories. 
  
2) Run the graph. For example to classify a single image:

       python classify_images.py images/zebra.jpg

   To classify all images in a directory you can use

       python classify_images.py images/

   Note that ResNet v1 requires images which are 224x224 pixels.

### Extra information

#### Options
The `classify_images.py` script has a few options. Use the `-h` flag or examine the code to understand them.

To endlessly loop through all the images use `--loop`.

#### Running on IPU Model
To run the inference demo on the Graphcore IPU Model, run with `TF_POPLAR_FLAGS="--use_ipu_model"`:

         TF_POPLAR_FLAGS="--use_ipu_model" python classify_images.py images/zebra.jpg

#### Interactive use
The module can also be used in a Python interactive session. For example:

    >>> from classify_images import ImageClassifier
    >>> ic = ImageClassifier()
        ... wait while graph is compiled ...
    >>> ic.classify_image('images/zebra.jpg')
   
    Filename : zebra.jpg
    Class 340: zebra 98.3%
    Class 292: tiger, Panthera tigris 0.905%
    Class 353: gazelle 0.186%
    Class 282: tiger cat 0.175%
    Class 352: impala, Aepyceros melampus 0.0706% 

### Troubleshooting

If you see an error saying cannot load pywrap_tensorflow.so then TensorFlow can probably
not find the Poplar libraries. You need to have Poplar installed and referenced by
LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
