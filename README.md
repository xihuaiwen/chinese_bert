### Application examples

The `applications/` folder contains example applications written in different frameworks targeting the IPU. See the READMEs in each folder for details on how to use these applications.

### Code examples

The `code_examples/` folder contains small code examples showing you how to use various software features when developing for IPUs. See the READMEs in each folder for details.

### Tutorials

The `tutorials/` folder contains tutorials to help you get started using the Graphcore tools. Currently, this contains:

* `tutorials/poplar` - A set of tutorials to introduce the Poplar framework and the Poplibs libraries.

### Utilities

The `utils/` folder contains utilities libraries and scripts that are used across the other code examples. Currently this is split into:

* `utils/examples_tests` - Common Python helper functions for the repo's unit tests.
* `utils/benchmarks` - Common Python helper functions for running benchmarks on the IPU in different frameworks.
