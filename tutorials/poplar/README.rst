Tutorials
=========

These tutorials provide hands-on programming exercises to enable you to
familiarise yourself with creating and running programs using Poplar and
Poplibs. They are intended to complement the `Poplar and Poplibs User Guide
<https://www.graphcore.ai/docs/poplar-and-poplibs-user-guide>`_.
It is assumed that you have already downloaded and installed Poplar, and that
you are familiar with C++ and command-line compilation tools.

You can find the documentation for the Poplar framework on the Graphcore
developer site: https://www.graphcore.ai/developer-documentation

For most of the tutorials we've included two directories. One, called
``start_here``, contains the bare structure of the tutorial as a starting point
and the other, ``complete``, contains the finished code for reference.
Each tutorial also has a ``test`` directory, which checks that the code can be
compiled and run. See the README file in each test directory for more information.

All the tutorials are in C++. They can run on a simulated IPU, so you should be
able to create the code, compile and run them as you work through this text even
if you do not have access to IPU hardware.

Each of the tutorials contains its own README file with full instructions.
